# MaterialRecyclingGame
As part of my final year project, I developed this game in Unity for school-going kids in elementary grades. 
This small game teaches kids about recyclable and non-recyclable objects. 

To play, the user can use the joystick provided in the scene to move our character, Mousey, around. 
When Mousey interacts with a recyclable object (i.e plastic, paper or glass) the score in the top left corner
will increase by 1. 

However, when interacted with a non-recyclable object (i.e food waste), the scene will reload to the start of the game and the score
will reset to 0. Additionally, the user will be informed that the item is not recyclable with a text displayed on scree

On the technical side, the app uses Unity's CineMachine Virtual Camera to focus on the character and its movements. 

Below are some images of the game.
